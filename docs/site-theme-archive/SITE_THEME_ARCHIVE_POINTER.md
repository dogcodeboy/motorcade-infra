# 🧹 SITE THEME — External Archive Pointer (Authoritative)

This file is the authoritative pointer for where **legacy/bulk** site theme artifacts live **outside** the repos.

## Why this exists
We zip only these repos for ChatGPT sessions:
- `~/Repos/motorcade-infra`
- `~/Repos/motorcade.vip`
- `~/Repos/motorcade-leadgen`

Large theme archives inside any of those repos cause `Repos.zip` uploads to time out.

## External archive location (locked for `site_01`)
- **External archive root (NOT included in `Repos.zip`):**
  - `~/Repos/Archives/motorcade/site-theme-legacy/`

## What goes there
- Theme zip/tar artifacts
- Legacy theme backups
- Old bulk asset packs that are not part of current render steps

## What stays in the repos
- Governance docs and manifests
- Source/theme code that is required to build the site
- Small, portable assets used by current approved renders
