# LeadGen Synthesis (Current)

- Conversion path: Lead → Assessment → Proposal → Contract → Execution.
- Phase 1 captures short intake only; phase 2 detailed questionnaire comes later.
- Geography starts Houston-first; other metros staged.

## Session Handoff Protocol (Mandatory)

Every session handoff MUST include:

1. References to the authoritative docs used in the session (link the exact paths).
2. A clean, compressed ZIP of the current repo state at handoff time.
3. A brief status summary that clearly states:
   - What is frozen
   - What is active
   - What must not be touched in the next session

If a topic is frozen by a checkpoint, future sessions MUST NOT modify it outside a dedicated polish phase.
