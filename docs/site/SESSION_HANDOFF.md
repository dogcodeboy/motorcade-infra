# SESSION HANDOFF — Site Theme Program

## What was fixed this session
- Replaced stub governance docs under `docs/site/` with substantial authoritative documents.
- Ensured hard-lock decisions are documented:
  - Custom WP intake plugin for 09B bridge (NOT CF7)
  - Services canon (people transport only; no goods/cargo/property transport)
  - Rapid Response is EP add-on only
  - Mobile nav hamburger/dropdown required
  - “Request a Security Assessment” CTA and remove “tactical”

## Where to start next session
1) Open: `docs/site/RUNBOOK.md`
2) Follow: `docs/site/SITE_BUILD_TREE.md`
3) Use: `docs/site/CHECKLIST.md`

## Next actions (recommended)
- Confirm site_01–05 locks are reflected in implementation work.
- Begin page-by-page Option A deliverables:
  - site_06.A assets then site_06.B render spec
  - repeat for each page (site_07..19)
- Complete gates:
  - site_20 hygiene (bulk removal)
  - site_21 compression
- Only then proceed to site_22 (bridge plugin).
