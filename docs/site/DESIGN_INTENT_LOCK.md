# 🟦 Design Intent & Visual Language Lock (site_02)

## Intent
Motorcade should feel:
- premium / executive
- controlled and calm
- enterprise-ready
- trustworthy and compliant

Avoid:
- militarized/tactical marketing tone
- loud “operator cosplay” visuals
- anything that invites licensing questions

## CTA language
Primary:
- **Request a Security Assessment**

Secondary (optional):
- Contact
- Learn more

## Visual direction (aligning to early mockup)
- Blueprint overlay is allowed as a subtle texture layer **if readability remains excellent**.
- Overlay must never reduce contrast; accessibility wins over “cool.”

## Design tokens (guideline defaults)
- Large section padding: 56–72px desktop, 32–44px mobile
- Card radius: 16–20px
- Button radius: 10–14px
- Card shadow: soft, minimal
- Typography: bold headings, readable body

## Acceptance criteria
- Any render spec references this intent
- Any future “color scheme drift” must be recorded in Audit/Delta
