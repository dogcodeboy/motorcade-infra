# 🟦 site_03 — Service Canon & Licensing Lock (CLOSED)

## Status
🔒 **CLOSED / LOCKED** — Do not reopen.

## Why this exists
Marketing drift creates legal risk. This document prevents accidental promotion of services we are not licensed to provide.

## Canonical services (public site scope)

### Executive Protection category (3 pages)
1) **Executive Protection (Core)**
2) **Transport (People Only)** — transport of people, not goods
3) **Escort (Vehicle Escort)** — escorting vehicles (including cargo vehicles as escort), not transporting goods

### Rapid Response
- **Rapid Response** is an **add-on option** for Executive Protection.
- It is not a standalone service category.
- It must appear as an add-on on all three EP pages.

## Explicit exclusions (do not mention on public site)
Do not mention:
- goods transport
- cargo transport services as a carrier
- “asset transportation”
- property delivery
- armed transport of valuables (unless explicitly licensed later)

Allowed wording:
- transporting people
- escorting vehicles
- escorting cargo vehicles **as security escort** (not as carrier)

## Copy safety checklist
Before approving any render spec:
- Does it imply we transport goods/property? If yes, reject.
- Does it create confusion about being the carrier? If yes, reject.
- Does it place Rapid Response outside EP context? If yes, reject.

## Acceptance criteria
- EP pages are grouped under Services dropdown properly
- Rapid Response appears only as EP add-on
- No copy contains goods/cargo transport claims
