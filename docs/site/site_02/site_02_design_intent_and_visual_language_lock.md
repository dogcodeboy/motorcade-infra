# 🟦 site_02 — Design Intent & Visual Language Lock (CLOSED)

## Status
🔒 **CLOSED / LOCKED** — Do not reopen.

## Design intent (north star)
Motorcade should feel:
- premium
- controlled
- enterprise-safe
- calm under pressure

Avoid:
- “tactical” / militarized marketing tone
- loud gimmicks
- anything that implies reckless behavior or illegal capability

## CTA language (locked)
Primary CTA:
- **Request a Security Assessment**

Avoid:
- “Request a Quote” (allowed only if explicitly needed in a later phase)

## Color & texture direction (compatibility with early mockup)
- Allow the “blueprint overlay” concept as a subtle texture layer, *only if readability remains high*.
- Overlay must be semi-transparent and never reduce contrast below accessible levels.

## Spacing & radius defaults (guidelines, not hardcoded)
These are design tokens and can be tuned, but changes must be recorded.

- Page section padding (desktop): 48–72px
- Page section padding (mobile): 28–40px
- Inner card padding: 24–32px
- Small radius (chips/buttons): 10–14px
- Card radius: 16–20px
- Large container radius: 24–28px

## Typography intent
- Headings: bold, compact line-height
- Body: readable line-height, strong contrast
- Keep copy concise; prioritize scannability

## Acceptance criteria
- This doc exists and is referenced by runbook
- Any future styling discussion references these tokens instead of re-arguing from scratch
