# 🟦 Services Canon & Licensing Lock (site_03)

## Executive Protection category (3 pages)
1) Executive Protection (Core)
2) EP Transport (People Only)
3) EP Escort (Vehicle Escort)

## Rapid Response (EP add-on only)
- Rapid Response is **not** a standalone category.
- It is an add-on option available across all three EP pages.

## Licensing-safe wording
Allowed:
- transporting people
- escorting vehicles
- escorting cargo vehicles (as escort/security), without implying we are the carrier

Forbidden (do not mention)
- transporting goods/cargo/property
- “asset transportation” services
- delivery / armed logistics carrier services
- anything implying we are the transporter of valuables

## Copy checks (must pass)
- No goods/cargo transport claim
- No “tactical” language
- No standalone Rapid Response marketing page

## Appendix — Gate Checks
- Must align with `docs/site/RUNBOOK.md` and `docs/site/DELTA_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Must not contradict locked decisions (`site_01`–`site_05`)
- Must remain portability-friendly (WordPress is temporary)

## Appendix — Stop Conditions
- If a future session proposes CF7 for intake, stop and use the custom bridge plugin path
- If copy implies goods/cargo/property transport, stop and correct per Services Canon
- If a page spec references missing assets, stop and complete Assets step first

## Appendix — Change Log (Append-only)
- 2026-01-29: Expanded to meet governance minimum-content gate and prevent drift
