# 🟦 site_04 — Navigation, IA & Responsive Rules (CLOSED)

## Status
🔒 **CLOSED / LOCKED** — Do not reopen.

## Navigation goals
- Simple, predictable structure
- Services grouped logically
- Mobile usability guaranteed

## Desktop navigation (intent)
Top nav:
- Home
- Services (dropdown)
- About
- Contact
- Login

Services dropdown:
- Executive Protection (Core)
- Transport (People Only)
- Escort (Vehicle Escort)
- (Rapid Response appears on EP pages as add-on, not as a dropdown item)

## Mobile navigation (required)
When screen width cannot support full nav:
- Provide a hamburger/dropdown menu trigger
- Menu must include same items as desktop
- Login must remain accessible

## Login intent
- A single “Login” entry routes to Auth Entry page (site_16)
- site_16 directs employees vs clients (future SSO later)

## Acceptance criteria
- Responsive nav exists as a defined behavior requirement
- No future session “forgets” mobile nav needs
