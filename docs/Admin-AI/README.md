# docs/Admin-AI (Canonical Home)

This directory is the single canonical home for Admin-AI build documentation.

- **ADMIN-AI_RUNBOOK.md**: master runbook with global numbered steps and authoritative repo links.
- **steps/**: Admin-AI core step docs.
- **services/**: service step docs (SSO/LDAP/Email/DNS/Audit/Secrets/Observability/Provisioning/Workers/Client-Portal/Employee-Portal).
- **references/**: optional space for copied references (not populated by default).

**Note:** Podman is installed as a standalone/static binary. Runbooks must not assume `dnf` manages Podman.
