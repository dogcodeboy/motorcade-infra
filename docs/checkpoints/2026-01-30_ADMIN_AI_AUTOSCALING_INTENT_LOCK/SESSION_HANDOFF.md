# SESSION HANDOFF — ADMIN AI AUTOSCALING INTENT LOCK

Status: ✅ intent locked (no implementation)

What was produced:
- `docs/intent.md` created as the canonical Admin-AI operational intent anchor.
- This checkpoint folder documents the locked intent as merge-safe, append-only artifacts.

Do not:
- Re-litigate ADMINAI_01–08 governance.
- Begin implementation without explicit authorization.
- Add pricing numbers or AWS-specific mechanisms into intent.

Resume point:
- Implementation planning can proceed within frozen governance + locked intent.
- Next planning topics (if needed): provider adapter boundaries, worker admission protocol, and observability metrics (still non-coding unless authorized).
