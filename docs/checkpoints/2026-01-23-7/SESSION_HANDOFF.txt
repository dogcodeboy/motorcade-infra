SESSION HANDOFF — CLEANUP (Docs-only)

- Updated motorcade-infra/docs/RUNBOOK.md to match current platform reality:
  - nginx frozen; PLAT_06A final
  - next execution point: PLAT_08A Podman/container services foundation
  - PLAT_07 nginx http2 modernize quarantined
  - reverse-proxy routing playbooks deferred/prohibited until nginx is explicitly reopened

- Added canonical runbook index files:
  - motorcade.vip/docs/runbooks/00_CANONICAL_RUNBOOK_INDEX.md
  - motorcade-leadgen/recovery/runbooks/00_CANONICAL_RUNBOOK_INDEX.md

Next session: generate PLAT_08A playbook + checkpoint per RUNBOOK.
