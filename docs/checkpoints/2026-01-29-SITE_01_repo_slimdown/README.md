# CHECKPOINT — 2026-01-29 — SITE_01 Repo Slimdown (External Archive)

## Goal
Shrink the session upload footprint by moving large **theme artifacts** out of the repos into an external archive.

## Locked archive root
`~/Repos/Archives/motorcade/site-theme-legacy/`

## In-scope for SITE_01
- Move large theme archives out of repo paths
- Remove moved files from git tracking (so repo shrinks)
- Add/maintain pointer + manifest docs (authoritative)

## Out of scope (do not do)
- No redesign
- No new pages
- No copy edits
- No CSS/template changes
