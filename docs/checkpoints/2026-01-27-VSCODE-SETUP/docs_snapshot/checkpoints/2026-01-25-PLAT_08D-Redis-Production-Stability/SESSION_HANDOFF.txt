SESSION HANDOFF — motorcade-infra — 2026-01-25

Status:
- PLAT_08D ran successfully on host `motorcade-web-01`.
- Redis now has bounded + self-healing healthcheck with systemd timer enabled.
- Output verified: Redis responds PONG; timer active.

Repo updates included in this checkpoint:
- RUNBOOK updated (minimal edits): platform progress updated; PLAT_08C/08D marked complete; next subsystem preserved.
- New docs/RESOURCES.md added with:
  - host naming rule (`motorcade-web-01` only)
  - redis healthcheck unit names and log commands
  - podman locked-path note (/usr/local/bin/podman)

Next step:
- Continue from the next PLAT_* item already listed under “Next Subsystem (Non-nginx)” in RUNBOOK.
- Do NOT reopen nginx items.
