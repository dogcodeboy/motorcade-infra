# NEXT_STEPS — After PLAT_03B

Next approved workstream:

**PLAT_04 — Application Connectivity (read-only verification first)**

Scope guidance:
- Validate connectivity using the new roles (start with `motorcade_ro`)
- No migrations
- No application wiring unless explicitly approved
- Preserve boot-disabled posture for Postgres
