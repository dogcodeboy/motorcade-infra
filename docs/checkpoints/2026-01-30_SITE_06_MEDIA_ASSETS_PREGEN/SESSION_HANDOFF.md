# SESSION HANDOFF — SITE_06 Media Asset Generation

## Session Context Summary (DO NOT SKIP)

The site build has moved away from auto-generated HTML packages.
The user is assembling the site manually in VS Code using approved
header/footer and layout scaffolding.

Previous attempts failed due to:
- Image sheets instead of individual assets
- Composite or cropped imagery
- Reuse of identical people across images
- Images containing embedded text
- Overuse of icons and overly abstract visuals

This checkpoint resolves those issues by locking rules.

## Visual Intent (High-Level)
Images must:
- Feel human, professional, and grounded
- Depict real-world executive protection / armed security scenarios
- Avoid stylized fog, heavy abstraction, or conceptual art
- Match the realism level of the approved hero image

## Locked Image Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Quantity:
- Exactly 25 images

Format:
- WEBP only
- Full resolution

Structure:
- One image per file
- No grids, no sheets, no collages
- No cropping required

Content:
- No text embedded in images
- No UI elements in images
- Natural lighting preferred
- Realistic environments (corporate, logistics, site security)

People:
- Do NOT reuse the same individuals across multiple images
- Vary gender, ethnicity, age appropriately
- Professional appearance only

Usage Targets:
- Hero alternatives
- Section dividers
- Service explanation blocks
- Trust / credibility reinforcement

## Delivery Rules
- Images are generated first
- Images are zipped AFTER generation
- ZIP(s) contain only final assets
- No preview composites required

## Next Authorized Action
Generate the 25 images per the above rules and deliver them as ZIP(s).
