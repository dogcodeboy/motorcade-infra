# CHECKPOINT — SITE_06 Media Assets (Pre-Generation)

Repository: motorcade-infra
Checkpoint ID: 2026-01-30_SITE_06_MEDIA_ASSETS_PREGEN

## Status
PRE-GENERATION CHECKPOINT — NO MEDIA ASSETS GENERATED

## Why This Checkpoint Exists
This checkpoint captures **all visual, structural, and process context**
required to safely continue image generation in a new session without
replaying prior discussion, reinterpreting intent, or drifting visually.

The previous session involved:
- Multiple failed UI generations
- Visual drift from approved mockups
- Session instability during media-heavy operations

This checkpoint freezes intent before heavy generation resumes.

## Canonical Source of Truth
- The OWNER-approved static site mockup images are authoritative
- No redesign, no reinterpretation, no creative liberties are permitted
- Images must support the existing mockup, not redefine it

## Current Implementation State
- Header and footer are approved and implemented locally in VS Code
- Site is being assembled manually (not auto-generated)
- Hero layout exists; imagery will be swapped in once final assets exist
- Below-the-fold sections will reference generated imagery

## Out of Scope
- HTML/CSS generation
- Layout changes
- WordPress or CMS work
- Asset wiring

This checkpoint is about **image generation only**.
