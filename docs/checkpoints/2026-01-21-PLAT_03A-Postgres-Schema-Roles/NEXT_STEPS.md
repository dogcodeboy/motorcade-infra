# NEXT STEPS (after PLAT_03)

Proceed to platform service scaffolding:
- PLAT_04 — Lead Intake API container (API-first) with migrations
- PLAT_05 — People API / guard roster service (later)

Important:
- Do **not** create tables manually.
- All tables must be created via migrations in the application repos.
