# PLAT_08C — Redis Bring-Up (Stability) — Checkpoint

This checkpoint captures the PLAT_08C failure mode where Redis bring-up becomes stuck due to
Podman/conmon logging incompatibility and an invalid readiness-gate model.

PLAT_08C is intentionally marked BLOCKED until replaced with a stable one-shot model.
