ADMINAI_01 — Minimal prerequisite state  
ADMINAI_02 — Authority boundaries & revocation  
ADMINAI_03 — Initial execution ordering & invariants  
ADMINAI_04 — Audit, observability, non-repudiation  
ADMINAI_05 — State model separation (Facts / Memory / Intent)  
ADMINAI_06 — Ownership model (OWNERs, break-glass)  
ADMINAI_07 — Interfaces & refusal behavior
