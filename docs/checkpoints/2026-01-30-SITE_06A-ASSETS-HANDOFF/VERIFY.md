# VERIFY — 2026-01-30-SITE_06A-ASSETS-HANDOFF

This checkpoint is docs-only.

✅ Confirmed:
- No changes were made to governance documents or RUNBOOK order.
- No site steps were renumbered.
- No HTML/CSS output from the degraded session is considered approved.

Next step to verify in the new session:
- site_06.A produces an asset manifest with canonical filenames, formats, and placement paths inside `motorcade-infra/docs/site/` (or wherever the SITE rules specify).
