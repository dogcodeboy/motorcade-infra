# ASSET EXPORT LOG — Session Generated Images (Split Zips)

This document tracks the exported image bundles produced during the degraded session.
These bundles are **not** repo content by default.

## Bundles
- session-images-part-01.zip
- session-images-part-02.zip
- session-images-part-03.zip
- session-images-part-04.zip
- session-images-part-05.zip

## Notes
- Contents include PNG/JPG/JPEG/WEBP generated renders and intermediate mockups.
- These images may include rejected variants; do not assume anything is approved.
- In the clean session, only copy assets into the repo after explicit approval and renaming to canonical filenames per SITE rules.
