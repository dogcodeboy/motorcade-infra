# CHECKPOINT — SITE_06A Assets (Handoff / Session Export)

Date: 2026-01-30
Repo: motorcade-infra

## Purpose
This checkpoint is a **docs-only** handoff created after a degraded session.
It does **not** change governance, RUNBOOK order, or any site step numbering.

It records:
- site_01 through site_05 are closed (per prior checkpoint)
- site_06.A (Assets) is the next authorized action
- this session generated multiple candidate images and mockup renders, but the resulting HTML/CSS exports **did not match** the approved mockup and are **rejected**
- all generated images were exported into split zip parts for reuse in a clean session

## What is approved
- The **approved visual reference** remains the authoritative target for site_06 Home.

## What is NOT approved
- Any HTML/CSS output produced in the degraded session is considered non-authoritative and should not be merged.

## Deliverables produced outside the repo (download artifacts)
- `session-images-part-01.zip`
- `session-images-part-02.zip`
- `session-images-part-03.zip`
- `session-images-part-04.zip`
- `session-images-part-05.zip`

These contain the generated images/renders from the session and are intended for **optional reuse**.
They are not considered "approved assets" until reviewed and explicitly accepted.

## Next authorized action
Proceed in a clean session with **site_06.A — Assets** only:
- enumerate required assets
- select/approve final asset set
- place assets into the repo **only after** approval and path/format validation

See `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for copy/paste instructions.
