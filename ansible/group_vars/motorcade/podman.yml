# Podman runtime settings (Motorcade)
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Podman on target servers is installed as a standalone/static install (NOT via dnf).
# - Therefore, dnf/package manager will not track Podman and playbooks MUST NOT attempt
#   to install/upgrade Podman with dnf/yum/package modules.
# - Use motorcade_podman_bin (locked path) and preflight checks to fail fast if missing.
#
# Default locked path used across Motorcade hosts:
motorcade_podman_bin: "/usr/local/bin/podman"

# Optional candidates (future-proof) if you ever decide to auto-detect instead of locking.
# Keep motorcade_podman_bin as the authoritative default unless governance changes.
motorcade_podman_candidate_paths:
  - "/usr/local/bin/podman"
  - "/usr/bin/podman"
  - "/bin/podman"
